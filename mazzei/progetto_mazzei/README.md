# Instructions for execution

To execute the programme, launch the run.sh script, and the virtual python environment will be loaded automatically.

The code produced does not use external libraries, so the virtual environment only ensures that the algorithm is executed with a compatible version of the interpreter.

There are `type hints` in the code, so you can run the demo with any version of Python >= 3.5.
